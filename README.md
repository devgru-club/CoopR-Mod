# What is CoopR-Mod?

At first glance a proficient ArmA 3 player would say CoopR-Mod is nothing new and just adds the same features every progress centered mission mod has. To be honest that is somewhat true. The core features look similar to existing mods. Having a player on a server that can be "upgraded" through a points system often called "Reputation Points" and adding new gear to the player as it upgrades over time. Having generated missions that on success push the progress of the mission based campaign. Oh and some hot and fancy features to add supplies, airdrops and such to the gameplay. Nothing new. Yet CoopR-Mod tries to deliver a deeper simulation of a soldier being deployed in a combat scenario. The unique selling point is to wrap a mission or task into a fully fledged management of resources, manpower and decisions. A mission or task should not feel like a "quick quest" to be finished. It should be treated as important as in real life. Casualties are in no way acceptable and therefore the planning is crucial. CoopR-Mod wants to bring this feeling to the gameplay and players should be enforced to really think about the steps to be taken before rolling out for a patrol or combat task.

# The Idea
CoopR-Mod is aimed to merge two kinds of gameplay. The first is having a mission mod that adds mechanics for player and squad progress, having a score system that acts as kind of currency to develop your soldier and his equipment and a set of features to bring support to the players and their squads. The second is to bring the squad/coop mission feeling to the player. Many squads or clans in ArmA 3 have their scheduled days where a mission is created by a gamemaster or managed through Zeus and the whole team is playing a high quality, thrilling mission. **CoopR-Mod wants to merge the fun of handmade coop missions and the mechanics of roleplay driven mission mods**.

## How is a mission feeling different in CoopR ?
Glad you asked! Well the mission generation itself won't be implemented by CoopR-Mod. You can use other mods to generate missions or tasks. For instance you can run CoopR-Mod on an ALiVE server where missions/tasks are generated by ALiVE. No - CoopR is wrapping "around" a mission. This will look like this. If you're playing with CoopR-Mod you do not have unlimited magic resources that appear in ammo boxes. Your soldiers do not have respawn tickets. Your requested supplies will not arrive within a few seconds. These are a few examples why a mission is way harder to finish successfully. Because of the mentioned contraints CoopR enforces you to prepare every mission in detail. Check possible ways to approach the target. Plan what kind of equipment you will need for the specified mission. Request needed resources early enough. Keep your squad prepared and ready. And remember that if a team-member is eliminated they will not respawn. All this makes a mission way more important and thrilling.

## Will there be official CoopR-Servers?
At the alpha testing phase there will be about two official servers hosted. These will have two different fictional scenarios. To join an official CoopR-Server you first have to register yourself on the offical CoopR-Website.

## Can I use my created characters on other servers?
Yes you can. The official CoopR-Servers will all be connected to the **CoopR-HQ**. The CoopR-HQ is the webservice that allows persistence of player created characters/soldiers. Every CoopR-Server is fetching the character list by a users Steam-ID from the CoopR-HQ. This allows players to switch between different servers and take part in different scenarios with their squads.
